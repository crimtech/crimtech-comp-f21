Before Crimson Tech, I've coded:
During hackathons and some side projects

I decided to comp Crimtech because:
I really like using code to work on real world projects, and this is a perfect
place to get that experience. I also love journalism, so it's nice to be in a
space where I can see tech and journalism come together. 

What I hope to get out of the comp is:
Honestly, just meeting new people and developing my programming skills. I 
feel like computer science classes are very theory based and because of that
my actual coding skills are lacking. I really want to hone in on my programming
skills. 

Ideas I have for making the comp more helpful or fun include:
Maybe we could all go to a hackathon together for fun. We could also diversify
what skills we use in CS. What if we made a mobile app? Integrated ML? 

A song that I would like added to the official Crimtech Comp Fall 2021 Playlist is:
Way Back Home by Shaun 

Questions or concerns I have about the comp, school, or life in general are:
Wow it's a lot to handle. College classes are a lot harder than high school
and it's hard finding my groove with... well everything. It's a process and 
while things are difficult now, I know I'm learning a lot as I go.
