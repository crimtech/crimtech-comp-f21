# "Midterm" Interview, Fall 2021
Welcome to the "midterm" interview! We are excited to hear more about how you're doing and how you're finding the comp so far. In Crimson tradition, we will also be asking you a few questions about the Crimson as well as Crimson Tech.

The interview will be _open book_, meaning you can use any notes to help you answer the questions. These interviews will take place during the comp meeting on Sunday, November 14 at 5 pm at the Crimson and will last ~10 minutes. If you cannot attend this meeting, please reach out to us ASAP to schedule an alternative time!

## Rough Structure
We aim to spend 3 minutes discussing how the comp is going for you, 3-4 minutes talking about life outside of the comp (your classses, extracurriculars, what you do for fun), and 3 minutes on the Crimson. We'll select some questions from the list below:

## General Questions
1. Who are your comp directors?
2. Who are the big three at the Crimson (president, managing editor, business manager)?
3. Who are the tech chairs at the Crimson?
4. Name two other people from the Crimson tech board other than the names above.
5. Tell us about a project the tech board has worked on/is working on in the past year.
6. Tell us the names of 5 compers in the comp class.
7. Who is the semi-secret Sorrento Square social organization that used to occasionally publish a so-called humor magazine?

## Technical Questions
1. Suppose I am in the `crimtech-comp-f21` folder. How do I move to the `snek` folder and run `snake.py` from my terminal?
2. How do I list all the files in a folder in the terminal?
3. Suppose Max and Olivia pushed some changes on to the remote branch. How do I pull these information into my local copy?
4. How do I resolve a merge conflict in Git?
5. Which steps do I need to take to submit a comp assignment?
6. How do I print "Hello World" in Python?
7. How do I print "Hello World" in Javascript?
8. In Yoda lab, how do I change the favicon of a webpage?
9. Suppose we have `<div id = "chat_box"></div>` in the HTML, and there is no other item with id "chat_box". How can I reference this div in javascript?
10. In Yoda lab, how do I make Yoda respond whenever the user presses Enter on their keyboard?
11. How many apples can the snake eat before the snake fills up the entire board?
